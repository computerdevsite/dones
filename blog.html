            <h2>What is a Virus?</h2>
            <p>A <strong>virus</strong> is a type of malicious software designed to spread from one computer to another, often causing harm. These harmful programs can corrupt files, slow down your system, or steal personal information. Viruses are usually spread through email attachments, infected websites, and file-sharing.</p>
            <p>To protect yourself from viruses, ensure you have updated antivirus software and avoid downloading files from untrusted sources.</p>

            <p>To protect yourself from spam, avoid clicking on links from unknown senders, and use email filters to block suspicious messages. Itâ€™s also a good idea to unsubscribe from any unwanted mailing lists.</p>

            <p>Using a reliable antivirus solution is essential for protecting your data and privacy. Keep the antivirus software updated and run regular system scans to identify potential threats.</p>
