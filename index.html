        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Crizza Dones is a 20-year-old young woman from Incarizan, 
            Magallanes, Sorsogon. She is the youngest daughter of Crisologo and Amy Dones, 
            and the youngest of three siblings. Her older siblings, Cris Mae and Carlo, have 
            always been a big part of her life, shaping her experiences and teaching her valuable 
            lessons along the way. Growing up in a close-knit family, Crizza learned the importance of love, 
            support, and community from a young age. From early childhood, Crizza exhibited a natural curiosity 
            and an undeniable passion for the arts. While her siblings explored their own interests, Crizza 
            found herself drawn to two specific fields: photography and music. These passions have been a 
            significant part of her life and have influenced the way she interacts with the world around her. 
            Photography became an obsession for Crizza during her teenage years. The allure of capturing 
            moments in timeâ€”whether it was a serene landscape or a candid moment between family membersâ€”fascinated her. 
            Armed with an old camera, gifted to her by her mother, Crizza began exploring photography more seriously. 
            As she learned the basics of composition, lighting, and framing, she discovered the power of images to tell 
            stories, evoke emotions, and preserve memories. Her family and friends soon recognized her talent, often 
            turning to her for photos at gatherings and special occasions. Crizzaâ€™s eye for detail and her ability 
            to capture beauty in the ordinary world became her signature style. Alongside her love for photography, 
            Crizza also developed a deep connection to music. Growing up in a household where music was always present, 
            she was inspired by her father, Crisologo, who had a deep appreciation for various genres and often played 
            his favorite tunes at home. Crizza was exposed to a variety of instruments from an early age, sparking her 
            interest in learning how to play them herself. She started with the guitar, slowly mastering its chords, and
             later ventured into the keyboard, where she found new ways to express herself through melodies. The act of 
             creating music brought her a sense of peace and fulfillment, providing a balance to her visual artistic pursuits. 
             As Crizza entered adulthood, her passion for both photography and music only intensified. She began to see the 
             possibility of combining the two, experimenting with multimedia projects that allowed her to merge her love for 
             images and sound. Her dream is to one day pursue a career where she can use both art forms to tell stories, whether 
             through photography, music videos, or other creative outlets. At just 20 years old, Crizza Dones is still in the 
             early stages of her journey. However, her determination and creative vision suggest that the future holds many 
             opportunities for her to grow and succeed in both photography and music. With the support of her family and a heart 
             full of dreams, Crizza is ready to explore the world and make her mark in the creative industries. .</p>
